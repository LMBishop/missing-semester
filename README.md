# The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (UoB Edition)

A fork of [MIT's Missing Semester](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester) Coursework.

As with the original, contributions are most welcome though might be more useful if submitted against MIT's repository.  If you have edits or new content to add, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Development

To build and view the site locally, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

If you'd prefer to develop the site in a Docker container (e.g., to avoid
having to install Ruby and dependencies on your host machine), run:


```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then, navigate to <http://localhost:4000> on your host machine to view the
website. Jekyll will re-build the website as you make changes to files.

## Manifesto

This is a statement of intent / purpose for UoB's Missing Semester series.  This may be updated over time.

### What is this?
Missing semester (MS) is series of interactive lectures that will help you learn skills that will make you a more effective computer user.  Rather than focus on using computers to accelerate the processing of data or to solve specific problems, MS is about learning how to become more proficient with computers themselves, specifically on the Linux operating system.

MS is a Companion to your UoB school of Computer Science (SoCS) coursework and will help prepare you so when you take more advanced classes, you're not learning Linux at the same time as you're learning the module's materials.

Through a series of interactive sessions, volunteers will help guide participants through some Linux fundamentals to more advanced topics.

MS is run by students for students.

### Origins
MS is a fork or modified version of MIT's Missing Semester.  We've taken MIT's materials as a starting point and have reorganized them to serve the UoB SoCS's needs / better integrate with our context.

### Assumptions / Requirements
We assume students have access to a Linux computer for MS.  Please drop by the [Linux Installfest](https://linux.afnom.net) on September 27th, 2023 if you're interesting in getting help installing Linux onto your personal computer.  Alternatively, you may use the SoCS's lab machines or a remote linux system if you have access to one.

### Who is this for?
We are targeting all computer science students who would like to gain more familiarity with Linux.  While these skills are not explicitly required in first year modules (with the exception of version control), you may find they help you work more efficiently and effectively.  Second Year students will need some of the tools described herein for their coursework and so it is recommended to start in your first year to get a head start.  We also welcome third and forth year undergrads, masters students (specifically conversion masters) and PhDs -- everyone is welcome.

### Format and Content
Everything about MS will be organized through the [Missing Semester Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jCWRjjA9gw).  If you have any questions about either the structure or content of MS, please ask there.

There will be 5 lectures to start with; you can read more about them and see the schedule on the [homepage of the missing semester site](https://missingsemester.afnom.net).

Each lecture is being run by one or more CS students.  The contents of the lectures will be left to whoever is running the session; they will be free to shape the lecture based on what they think is most relevant / useful.

The structure of the sessions will be highly interactive; we like to think of them as "hack and tell" sessions.  Participants are encouraged to follow along with the instructors and explore the commands / tools being described.  Each lecture also includes some additional exercises for more exploration.

MS is a not a class; there are no grades and no checking of assignments.  The contents and exercises are purely designed to give curious computer scientists a means to explore and improve at their own speed.  We welcome participants to invest as much time as they like but it should be possible to engage with MS alongside your normal coursework.

### Who is running this?
Volunteers from [AFNOM](https://afnom.net) and [CSS](https://https://cssbham.com/) are running MS.  This includes managing / supporting students on the discord as well as planning and executing the lectures.

### The Future
Depending on the success of the first 5 lectures, we may run more later in the semester.

For now, we will not be recording the lectures but we may reconsider this in the future.
